The management package provides server-behavior for responding 
to requests relating to the health-and-status, and network 
management queries.

This relationship can be shown as:

1) simple client-server

Client (HeartMonitor) ----> Server (ManagementHandler)

2) server-server

Server (ManagementHandler + HeartMonitor) ----> Server (ManagementHandler)



Reference
**********

2. For every HeartMonitor there is a HeartBeatListener added.
3. In HeartMonitor.js Connect() function will create a function and keep the connection active
